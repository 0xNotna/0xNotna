I'm an aspiring IT professional transitioning from a delivery background into tech. My interest in IT started years ago through gaming (Runescape) and grew into a genuine passion for troubleshooting, systems, and cybersecurity.

Now I'm focused on building real-world skills through labs, personal projects, and certifications like CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+. This GitHub is where I share what Iâ€™m learning and working on as I pursue a career in IT support.
